            Hello, and welcome to Sudoku!<br><br>
            This is a game that is played on a 9 x 9 board of squares.
            The board is divided into 3 x 3 squares, 9 in total.
            The goal of Sudoku is to fill in all of the tiles on the board
            such that every square, row, and column has the numbers 1 through 9. <br><br>

            Of course, this means that each number can only be used once in each square,
            row, and column. This site offers four difficulties of randomly generated boards,
            with harder boards containing fewer starting numbers. <br><br>

            But don't worry! Every board will have a solution. Follow the logic of the
            numbers on the board and solve the board! <br><br>

            If you understand these instructions, click the "OK" button below to begin.
